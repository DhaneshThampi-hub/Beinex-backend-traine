'''Task â€“ 1
Create a class called Add , it must have __call__ defined. Create an object of that class.
When the object is directly called with a list of integers - like - obj([1,2,3,4,5]) It must return the sum 
of elements in the list.
Eg:
add = Add()
total = add([1,2,3,4,5,6])'''




class Add:
    def __call__(self, numbers):
        return sum(numbers)
add = Add()
numbers_list = input('enter number by comma: ')
lst=[int(num)for num in numbers_list.split(',')]
total_sum = add(lst)
print(f"Total sum of elements in the list: {total_sum}")
